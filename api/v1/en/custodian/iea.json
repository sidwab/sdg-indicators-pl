Reducing energy consumption suggests the fact that less energy is needed to produce the same amount of GDP and is associated with an increase in energy efficiency. Gross domestic consumption of energy presents the amount of energy required to meet domestic consumption of a geographical unit and is calculated as follows: the acquisition of primary energy + fuel recovery + import + change in inventories - export - 'bunker'. Gross domestic energy consumption includes consumption of coal, electricity, crude oil, natural gas and renewable energy. Kgoe stands for kilogram of oil equivalent (contractual), which is a unit of measurement of energy used in international balance sheets. It indicates the amount of energy that can be produced from the combustion of one metric kilogram of crude oil. One tonne of oil is equal to the contractual 41.868 GJ or 11.63 MWh.",
