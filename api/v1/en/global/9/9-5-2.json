R&D personnel, apart from conducting R&D activities, may also arrange and manage R&D projects, prepare reports, provide direct ICT, library and documentation maintenance in a given project as well as provide administrative services in the area of finance and human resources. Researchers (i.e. professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems and also in the management of the projects) constitute the most numerous group of R&D personnel.The group ‘pracownicy naukowo-badawczy’ is a Polish equivalent of the researchers group (presented in Frascati Manual), also named as ‘scientists and engineers’. Belonging into this group requires neither formal qualifications nor occupying a specific post. Full-time equivalents (FTE) are conversion units used to determine actual employment in R&D . One full-time equivalent (FTE) means one person-year devoted exclusively to R&D activities. Employment in R&D in full-time equivalents is calculated on the basis of the ratio of working time devoted to R&D by particular employees within a reporting year to full working time on a particulate position in a given institution. Full-time equivalent is the only measure of employment in R&D used in international comparisons and international publications issued by OECD and EUROSTAT.",
