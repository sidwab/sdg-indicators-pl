It involves three types of activities, that is, basic research, applied research (including industrial) and experimental development. Intramural expenditures on R&amp D include expenditures on R&amp D performed within a statistical unit, whatever the source of funds. They involve both current and capital expenditures linked to R&amp D activities. Current expenditures on R&amp D include personnel costs as well as costs of used materials, non-durable articles and energy, costs of external services (other than R&amp D ) including external processing, transport, renovation, banking, postal, ICT, publishing or municipal services, costs of business trips and other current costs including, in particular, taxes and fees charging costs of activity and profits, property insurance, and equivalents for the benefit of employees â€“ in a part in which they relate to R&amp D .

Gross domestic product (GDP) presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy. GDP is equal to the sum of gross value added generated by all national institutional units, increased by taxes on products and decreased by subsidies on products. Gross domestic product is calculated according to obligatory in the European Union countries principles of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and recommendations of the Eurostat.",
